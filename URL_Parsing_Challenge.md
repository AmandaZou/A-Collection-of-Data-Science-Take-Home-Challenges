URL Parsing Challenge
================

# Goal

Being able to efficiently parse URLs and extract info from them is a
very important skill for a data scientist.

Firstly, if you join a very early stage startup, it might be that a lot
of data are just stored in the URLs visited by the users. And,
therefore, you will have to build a system that parses the URLs,
extracts fields out of it, and saves them into a table that can be
easily queried (not the most fun of the jobs, but very useful\!).

Secondly, often using external data can help a lot your models. And a
way to get external data is by scraping websites. And this is often done
by being able to play with a given site URL structure (assuming it is
allowed by the external site ToS).

The goal of this project is to parse a sequence of URLs about user
searches and extract some basic info out of it.

# Challenge Description

Company XYZ is a Online Travel Agent site, such as Expedia, Booking.com,
etc.

They haven’t invested in data science yet and all the data they have
about user searches are simply stored in the URLs the users generate
when they search for a hotel. If you are not familiar with URLs, you can
run a search on any OTA site and see how all search parameters are
always present in the URL.

You are asked to:

1)  Create a clean data set where each column is a field in the URL,
    each row is a given search and the cells are the corresponding URL
    values.

For each search query, how many amenities were selected?

2)  Often, to measure the quality of a search algorithm, data scientists
    use some metric based on how often users click on the second page,
    third page, and so on. The idea here is that a great search
    algorithm should return all interesting results on the first page
    and never force users to visit the other pages (how often do you
    click on the second page results when you search on Google? Almost
    never, right?).

Create a metric based on the above idea and find the city with the worst
search algorithm.

# Data

The file is:

url\_list - a list of search URLs generated by the users when searching
for hotels

## Fields:

hotel.checkin : checkin date in the search query. It is mandatory
hotel.customMinimumPriceFilter : This filter allows to only return
hotels whose nightly price is above a certain threshold (in USD). Useful
to filter out the really bad hotels hotel.customMaximumPriceFilter :
This filter allows to only return hotels whose nightly price is below a
certain threshold (in USD). Useful to filter out the hotels you can’t
afford hotel.freeCancellation : It is a check box. If the user selects
it, only hotels with free cancellation are returned. hotel.stars\_5 : It
is a check box. If the user selects it, 5-star hotels are returned.
Multiple choices are allowed. For instance, a user can select 5 and 4
star hotels by checking this box and the one below. If no check box is
selected, all hotels are returned. hotel.stars\_4 : It is a check box.
If the user selects it, 4-star hotels are returned hotel.stars\_3 : It
is a check box. If the user selects it, 3-star hotels are returned
hotel.stars\_2 : It is a check box. If the user selects it, 2-star
hotels are returned hotel.stars\_1 : It is a check box. If the user
selects it, 1-star hotels are returned hotel.max\_score : This filter
allows to only return hotels whose score is below a certain threshold.
Score is 1-5 with high being good (you can think of TripAdvisor score to
get an idea of what it is) hotel.min\_score : This filter allows to only
return hotels whose score is above a certain threshold hotel.couponCode
: If the user uses a coupon in her search, this fields gets populated
with “Yes” hotel.adults : Number of adults in the search query. This sis
the number of adults who would stay in the same room. It is mandatory
hotel.city : Which city is the user searching for. It is mandatory
hotel.children : Is the user traveling with children? This field returns
the number of children in the search query hotel.amenities : There are a
few amenities that the user can select in her search via different check
boxes. The possible amenities are: shuttle: free shuttle transportation
from the airport internet: free internet breakfast : free breakfast
lounge : does the hotel have a lounge yes\_smoking : are there rooms
where smoking is allowed yes\_pet : is it allowed to bring pets
hotel.checkout : Check out date. It is mandatory hotel.search\_page :
Search page visited. 1 means the user in on the first page results, 2
-\> clicked on the second page etc. This will be used to estimate the
goodness of ranking for different cities

urls <- read.table("url_list.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
urls1 <- gsub("http://www.mysearchforhotels.com/shop/hotelsearch?", "", urls[,1], fixed = TRUE)

# Question 1:

Transform the URL data

Process and clean the data

``` r

names(url_data) <- c("id", url_fields)
url_data$id <- seq(1, nurls, by = 1)
```

Build the rectangular data set.

``` r

  for(field in url_fields){

``` r
# Check if any rows exist with all fields other than id missing
any(rowSums(is.na(url_data)) == ncol(url_data[,-1]))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

Every search query need not have all the fields specified. So, the
cleaned dataset is expected to be sparse (several missing values in each
row). No rows exist with all fields other than id missing.

``` r
# Check if missing values exist for search page
sum(is.na(url_data$hotel.search_page))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
# Check missing values for city
sum(is.na(url_data$hotel.city))
```

    ## [1] 0

No missing values exist in critical fields. The data looks good.

Count number of amenities for every search

``` r
# Frequency by categories
table(url_data$hotel.amenities, useNA = "always")
```

    ## 
    ##           breakfast   breakfast,yes_pet            internet 
    ##                  39                   1                 272 
    ##              lounge             shuttle             yes_pet 
    ##                  22                 111                  85 
    ##         yes_smoking yes_smoking,yes_pet                <NA> 
    ##                 170                   4               76973

``` r
# Count the amenities searched by splitting at "," for searches involving multiple amenity selection
url_data <- url_data %>%
  mutate(amenities_count = ifelse(is.na(hotel.amenities), 0, str_count(hotel.amenities, ",") + 1))

table(url_data$amenities_count, useNA = "always")
```

    ## 
    ##     0     1     2  <NA> 
    ## 76973   699     5     0

Clearly, More than 99% of the searches does not have any amenity
selected. Only less than 1% of searches have one or more amenities
selected and highest number of amenities selected in a search is two.

# Question 2:

A good search algorithm should rank the most relevant search results
highly and hence show interesting results in the first page. I think
users having to look at second page of search results is as bad as
having to look at 10th page because most users don’t bother to go beyond
first page and ones shown in later pages may not reach the user. So, it
makes sense to bin searches into two categories one where searches are
found on first page and second category being any where else other than
first page.

The metric I choose to know the relavancy of search results, in other
words performance of search algorithm, is “the fraction of searches with
users looking beyond first search results page”. The lower the value of
this metric, the better is the relavancy of search results and the
search algorithm. If large percentage of users looked beyond the first
page then this metric will go up and indicate that search algorithm is
not performing well.
